# Flask (web framework)

is a micro [web framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework "Web framework") written in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python (programming language)"). It is classified as a [microframework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microframework "Microframework") because it does not require particular tools or libraries. 

It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.

Applications that use the Flask framework include [Pinterest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinterest "Pinterest") and [LinkedIn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn "LinkedIn").
